# springboot-jsp-dynamic-web-skeleton
 
 ## Introduction
 
 This is my assignment 2 of Funix about buiding an dynamic website skeleton but I redo using Spring Boot (with Spring MVC and Spring Security) and jsp 
 
  ## Version
 
-	Java 12
-	Spring Tool Suite 4 (Version: 4.3.2.RELEASE) 
-	Maven (version 3.6.1)
-	Tomcat (version 9.0.22) but not included in this assignment. As a result please download yourself 
-	Bootstrap (version 4.3.1)
- Other components are used according to “pom.xml” in each project

## How to install
please import as a maven project

## Project Detail
-	This is the project like the spring project above but also include Spring boot . The reason is due to I have never config a spring boot project with jsp so I think It maybe a good chance 
-	Other than to feel the way to config . Everything (from Controller , Model and View ) are nearly the same as [above Spring project](https://github.com/JimmyYouhei/springmvc-and-springsecurity-dynamic-web-skeleton)  
-	Just to recap, like the project above this project still follow MVC architecture 

## Possible issue
-	Minimal testing and only follow Funix requirement. And not yet trying to break the system by myself so there maybe bug outside of Funix Requirement

## Known Issue
-	Bad front-end design: I hate graphic design so please
